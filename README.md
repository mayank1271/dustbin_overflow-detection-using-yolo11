# 🗑️ Dustbin Overflow Detection using YOLOv11

This is a personal Computer Vision project built using **YOLOv11** and **Python**.  
The goal is to detect the **status of dustbins** in public or home environments — whether they are **empty**, **overflowing**, or if **garbage is lying outside**.

## 📌 Features

- Detects:
  - ✅ Empty dustbins
  - ❌ Overflowing dustbins
  - 🗑️ Garbage outside the bin
- Trained using a custom dataset
- YOLOv11 used with **hyperparameter tuning** for better accuracy
- Real-time detection possible via webcam or mobile cam stream

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- [Ultralytics YOLOv11](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)  
- OpenCV  
- Custom-labeled dataset  
- Git & GitHub
